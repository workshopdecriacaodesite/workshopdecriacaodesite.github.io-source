# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "This article presents an ongoing research focusing on the development of a platform for generative networked creation. That is, a process of creation in which several collaborators act on different parts during the artistic creation while a computer network integrates communication between these agents and processes generative transformations. Therefore, we established a working methodology with a group of thirteen researchers of the Interdisciplinary Nucleus for Sound Studies (NICS), Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers and senior researchers. Our proposal was to distribute the stages of the collaborative process in separate generative modules and develop a network architecture to enable interaction between the elements and, finally, perform a multimodal work as a result of the information flow circulating in the network."
